# javascript-password-generator

The purpose of this assignment was to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The HTML, CSS and Javascript sheets were provided. The function GeneratePassword was created before asking for password length. Mandatory password criteria needed to include an length of 8 to 128 characters. Otherwise user could not continue with generator. Five variables were created in order to create a password based on the criteria selected by user. Which includes upper case letters, lower case letters, special characters and numbers. All variables would later be collected in the variable named collectionOfValids. Variables were selected via confirm windows. Each variable running a for loop to help generate the code. Along with the .push method in adding new items to the end of each array within the length selected by the user.  Math.floor(math.random()) are used to randomly select applciable characters that meet the users input criteria to generate a random password. Random password is then displaced in the card provided.
